# second_app

A new Flutter project

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
=======
This is where we will place shared code.

Please be _very_ careful editing code in this directory. Similarly, don't add code to this directory until you are sure it has genuine usefulness in multiple vignettes, and you have cleaned up & tested it.

You can use these classes in a vignette by adding a dependency in your pubspec.yaml file:

```
dependencies:
  shared:
    path: ../_shared/
```
